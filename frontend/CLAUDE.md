# frontend/

See the root `CLAUDE.md` for project-wide rules. This module is the Vite + React +
TypeScript SPA.

## Ownership boundary

This is the "frontend" module for future multi-agent work: an agent scoped to this
directory should never need to know FRM/vanilla-API response shapes, database schema,
or polling logic — only the types exported from `@satisfactory-dash/shared` and
whatever REST/WebSocket endpoints `backend/` documents. If you find yourself reaching
for a type or shape that isn't in `@satisfactory-dash/shared`, that's a signal the
contract needs to grow, not that this module should special-case a backend detail.

## Conventions

- Plain client-side React (hooks, components) — no server components, no file-based
  routing framework.
- `VITE_API_URL` (see `.env.example`) points at the backend; never hardcode
  `localhost:3001`.
- Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library (`npm run test`). New components should get a
  test that renders them and asserts on user-visible behavior, not implementation
  details.
